Word Search Solver with UI

This project started with the idea of creating an image to word
search solver. We found that google OCR and some other OCR software
give poor results when reading in 2D character arrays. We believe
this is because they too often predict that there will be separate
words and sentence punctuation, as opposed to a character array.

We decided to use newOCR.com as they gave us good results and support
an API to tie into our back end. However, the documentation of the API
made it impossible to use, and they did not return emails
inquiring about their specifications. Therefore, to solve new word
searches from image you must use segment the word search image into
character array and word list, and then export .txt files after feeding
the image files into the newOCR.com UI.

Our API code file and case handling is currently still hooked in. Therefore,
if you select an image file it will try to ping newOCR.com, however it will
only receive a 400 Error back (bad request).

Otherwise, we have included test cases to show the use of our solver UI
and algorithm in .txt file format.

In terms of our UI, there are some limitations that tkinter creates. If you
try to solve an array larger than 20x20, the rows and columns will not
completely fit into the frame. We decided that instead of returning an
exception for the array being too large (which makes it sound like our back
end doesn't support larger arrays) we would leave it in so that larger
arrays can be tested and checked, even if they don't look great on the UI.

The UI was designed and tested in an Ubuntu VM.
